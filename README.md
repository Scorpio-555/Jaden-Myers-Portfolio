## Data Wrangling

### Summary

As a final project for my data wrangling class, we had to find four different data files from reputable sources and wrangle the data using the R programming language. Then I had to answer five questions using visualizations that I created from the data. 

Questions:

* How does a stateâ€™s color, Red vs. Blue, affect different aspects of COVID?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the percent of the state population that are fully vaccinated?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the COVID testing per hundred?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the COVID cases per hundred?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the COVID deaths per hundred?
