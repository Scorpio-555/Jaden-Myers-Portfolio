## Data Wrangling

### Summary

As a final project for my data wrangling class, we had to find four different data files from reputable sources and wrangle the data using the R programming language. Then I had to answer five questions using visualizations that I created from the data. 

Questions:

* How does a stateâ€™s color, Red vs. Blue, affect different aspects of COVID?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the percent of the state population that are fully vaccinated?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the COVID testing per hundred?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the COVID cases per hundred?

* Is there a correlation between a state being red or blue and the COVID deaths per hundred?

## Test Driven Developement using Java

### Summary:

For this group assignment, we were tasked with creating an app using AndroidStudio. Only the part that I was assigned is included in this portfolio. As a group we decided to create an app for those who have diabetes. I was in charge of writing classes that handled medications the user was currently taking. The file [Main.java](https://github.com/Scorpio-555/medication_prescription_handler/blob/original/src/medication_prescription_handler/Main.java) contains the test code from which the classes were developed using Test Driven Developement.
